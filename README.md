# **Machinery Fault Signal Detection with Deep One-Class Classification**

I have implemented Deep SVDD & other one-class classification algorithms in PyTorch

Additionally Deep SVDD is written based on https://github.com/lukasruff/Deep-SVDD-PyTorch

----------------

# **Repository structure**

Contains the data. I implemented support for Case Western Reserve University (CWRU) & Paderborn University (Paderborn)

- CWRU(https://engineering.case.edu/bearingdatacenter)
- Paderborn(https://mb.uni-paderborn.de/kat/forschung/kat-datacenter/bearing-datacenter/data-sets-and-download)

To utilize for anomaly detection, the datasets must be downloaded from the original sources
